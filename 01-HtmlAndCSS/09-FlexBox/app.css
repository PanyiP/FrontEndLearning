/* FlexBox: For laying out items in rows and columns
 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout
 
 Must be set on Container:
  display: flex; -> set a container to Display: flex;
  align-content: Controls the spacing between rows or columns along the CROSS axis. Only matters if the content WRAPS.: CENTER, SPACE-BETWEEN, FLEX-START, FLEX-END
  align-items: How to place content along the CROSS axis.: STRETCH, CENTER, FLEX-START, FLEX-END
  flex-direction: Switches the flow of the flex container by switching up the MAIN and CROSS axis.: ROW, COLUMN
  flex-wrap: WRAP; -> Enables moving items to more lines. If set to NOWRAP the item sizes are shrinked to fit into the container
                      (if container size is set to a fixed value).
  justify-content: How to place content along the MAIN axis.: CENTER, SPACE-BETWEEN, FLEX-START, FLEX-END

 Must be set on Items:
  align-self: Same as align-items, but for only a single item.: STRETCH, CENTER, FLEX-START, FLEX-END
  flex-basis: Sets the initial main size of a flex item. It sets the size of the content box unless otherwise set with box-sizing (width/height).
  flex-grow: Dictates how much of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.
             flex-grow: 2; -> The item should take up twice as much space as other items.
  flex-shrink: If the size of all flex items is larger than the flex container, items shrink to fit according to flex-shrink.
            flex-shrink: 3; -> This element shrinks 3 times faster than the other elements.
  flex: short for <flex-grow> <flex-shrink> <flex-basis>
  order: Sets the order to lay out an item in a flex or grid container.
